# Hand Tracking

Created a web app named "Virtual Mouse" that the user can control with the tip of his/her index finger in order to control the cursor using the webcam.
Many different actions can be performed like left click, right click and even switch between the application.
The model was deployed locally, using streamlit(a web framework).
